# Quantum_Espresso_Tutorial
# Quantum_Espresso is a Open-Source software for electronic-structure calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT), plane waves, and pseudopotentials. 
# This tutorial will guide you through a step by step complete sequence of optimizations and processes required to obtain the desired electronic properties. 

    # For the lowest energy structure i.e equillibrium structure - 
    1. Perform variable cell relax (vc-relax). vc-relax optimizes all parameters including crystal structure 
    
    
    2. Before performing vc-relax we need to select appropriate kinetic energy, charge density energy cutoffs along with appropriate Brillouin zone sampling k-mesh.
