In this project, we share the Quantum Espresso files and related scripts used to generate the data for the investigations assessing the impact of triaxial strain and B-cation on the structural and electronic properties of bulk halide perovskites.

The file descriptions are as follows:
1. Bash scripts to generate and extract the relax, SCF, bands, and other post-processing input and output files with the strained lattice.
2. Bash scripts to calculate effective mass and carrier mobility under the semi-classical acoustic phonon limited scattering regime.

At the time of this project's creation on GitHub, the data had already been published in AIP Advances. The research paper can be found at https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/13/12/125304/2925757.
